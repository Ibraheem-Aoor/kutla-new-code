Senator Kamala Harris of California became the nation’s first African American woman nominated for the vice presidency of the United States. It is a moment to be savored, a time to reflect, and a new journey to begin. Shirley Chisholm was the first African American woman elected to Congress, and the first Black major party candidate to run for president of the United States. In 1972 she said, “at present, our country needs women’s idealism and determination, perhaps more in politics than anywhere else.” The historicity of this hour reminds us again of that idealism, determination, and authentic sensitivity we often find in women. It just seems to be a part of who they are. It often appears in the way they govern. There is an undying belief on the part of women, expressed in the words of former presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, “we are agents of change, we are drivers of progress, we are makers of peace – all we need is a fighting chance.” This is a bold move on the part of Vice President Joe Biden. It is another opportunity for our nation to move a little closer towards a more perfect union. It is a union for which Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said, “one day we will judge people not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.” While the NAACP does not endorse candidates, we are compelled to recognize the historic impact of these rare moments in time. This election will really be for the very soul of our nation. As the author James Cone has written When My Soul Looks Back, “it wonders how I get over.” I can hear the voice of Harriet Tubman humming. I can hear Ida B.

Herds of wild animals, flocks of birds, vast spread across lands and water bodies filled with wilderness? That\'s not all. There is no better place than the Sundarbans if you want to enjoy nature by sitting on the deck of the ship, watching crocodiles sunbathing by the side of the river channels that are spread across the large mangrove forest like spider webs.&nbsp;</p><p style="margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 24px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: roboto, sans-serif, &quot;siyam rupali&quot;; letter-spacing: 0.5px; white-space: pre-line;">The best time to visit the Sundarbans is winter, especially from November to March.

Senator Kamala Harris of California became the nation’s first African American woman nominated for the vice presidency of the United States. It is a moment to be savored, a time to reflect, and a new journey to begin. Shirley Chisholm was the first African American woman elected to Congress, and the first Black major party candidate to run for president of the United States. In 1972 she said, “at present, our country needs women’s idealism and determination, perhaps more in politics than anywhere else.” The historicity of this hour reminds us again of that idealism, determination, and authentic sensitivity we often find in women. It just seems to be a part of who they are. It often appears in the way they govern. There is an undying belief on the part of women, expressed in the words of former presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, “we are agents of change, we are drivers of progress, we are makers of peace – all we need is a fighting chance.” This is a bold move on the part of Vice President Joe Biden. It is another opportunity for our nation to move a little closer towards a more perfect union. It is a union for which Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said, “one day we will judge people not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.” While the NAACP does not endorse candidates, we are compelled to recognize the historic impact of these rare moments in time. This election will really be for the very soul of our nation. As the author James Cone has written When My Soul Looks Back, “it wonders how I get over.” I can hear the voice of Harriet Tubman humming. I can hear Ida B. Wells declaring, Fannie Lou Hamersinging, and Shirley Chisholm calling out the words of that old gospel song “he didn’t bring us this far to leave us.” It is time for everyone regardless of color, station, or vocation to Take Your Soles To The Polls.

Students may choose from a pre-professional Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Dance Performance or from the more broad based Bachelor of Arts degree in Dance. Both degrees provide excellent preparation for those who plan to enter the professional dance world and/or attend graduate school. The curriculum for dance majors includes course work in choreography, dance history, dance production, dance performance, acting, music for dancers, dance science, dance teaching methods, ballroom, somatics, hip-hop, tap, and comprehensive pre-professional training in modern, jazz and ballet technique. The USC Glorya Kaufman School of Dance offers a Bachelor of Fine Arts to a select number of undergraduates who wish to pursue dance as their major. This four-year professional degree is housed in the state-of-the-art Glorya Kaufman International Dance Center. USC Kaufman also offers individual classes technique, performance, choreography, production, theory and history that are open to all students at USC. In addition to the dance major and open courses, the minor in Dance and minor in Dance in Popular Culture: Hip-Hop, Urban and Social Dances, provide a rewarding program of study for any USC student. A conservatory-based program within a liberal arts environment, we are focused on rigorous training in both ballet and modern technique. We are committed to the creation and production of original contemporary choreographic works by students, faculty and guest artists. The Dance Program is housed in its own state-of-the-art Dance Centre on a large liberal arts campus. USF is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Dance (NASD). Students must apply for admission and be accepted to the University of South Florida before they can be accepted as a Dance Major in the School of Theatre and Dance. Additionally, all prospective Dance Majors and Dance Minors must audition during the year prior to their first semester to be accepted into the Dance Program.</span>','status' => '1','breaking_news' => '0','date' => '2021-09-21','tags' => 'entertainment','speciality_id' => '3','reporter_id' => '1','image' => '["uploads\\/images\\/newsimages\\/maannewsimage24102021_051716_enter.jpg"]','user_id' => '1','archive' => '0','viewers' => '75','meta_keyword' => NULL,'meta_description' => NULL,'created_at' => now(),'updated_at' => now()),

This modesty-saving Victorian codpiece was hastily made to cover the Down There on Michelangelo’s David, shortly after Queen Victoria had been horrified at the sight of the stark naked plaster cast of the classic Renaissance sculpture—a shock she experienced in 1857, at the opening of her own museum, the Victoria &amp; Albert.<br><br>This big, veined fake fig leaf is an opening gambit in the “Undressed” introduction to “Fashioning Masculinities: The Art of Menswear,” the new Gucci-sponsored exhibition at the V&amp;A. It’s positioned right across from a pair of late-1980s fig leaf-printed briefs by Vivienne Westwood, a 1996 Jean Paul Gaultier trompe l’oeil Greek god torso blazer, and an installation of 2021 underwear for transgender men and transmasculine non-binary people by gc2b and Paxies.<br><br>Cleverly, “Undressed” starts us off with a confrontation with the dominant Western European archetypes of the male body. By way of an edit of the plaster-casts that began the V&amp;A’s original art-educational collection, it argues that everything can be traced back to men comparing themselves to the iconography of classical Greek, Roman, and Renaissance sculpture. Take Hercules, with his bulging muscles: “The normalization of hyper-masculinity like this has spawned contemporary gym culture,” reads a caption (we see a 1990s Calvin Klein underwear ad nearby). Or the boyish body of Hermes: “The idolization of youth resonates in the treatment of young male models and performers.” Never a truer word, when you think of Hedi Slimane’s abiding adherence to the straight up-and-down teenage body. One of Slimane’s Dior Homme motorcycle jackets and skinny tailored trousers, with which he dramatically narrowed menswear proportions in the early 2000s, is in the show. That it looks so unremarkable 20 years later is testament to the sweeping influence of his look, for a good few years.<br>Image may contain Human Person Mannequin and Shop</span></p></div>','status' => '1','breaking_news' => '0','date' => '2021-09-14','tags' => 'National','speciality_id' => '4','reporter_id' => '1','image' => '["uploads\\/images\\/newsimages\\/maannewsimage23102021_065512_slider-1.jpg"]','user_id' => '1','archive' => '0','viewers' => '574','meta_keyword' => NULL,'meta_description' => NULL,'created_at' => now(),'updated_at' => now()),

This is a reversal of recent trade flows, which saw cold-gripped New York Harbor import at least 4.5 million barrels of diesel from Europe and Russia since the start of the year for power generation and home heating. <br><br>Diesel exports from the Gulf coast to Europe are also picking up, with around 103,000 barrels a day heading to the continent so far this month, compared with 19,000 in February, Kpler estimates. This trade route is more common, although it has diminished in the last year or two, with Latin America absorbing much of the U.S. export diesel market. <br><br>But the flow of U.S. clean products will “redirect toward Europe if European buyers are less willing to lift out of Russia,” said Reid I’anson, senior commodity economist at Kpler. <br><br>The transatlantic diesel pull is taking place even as Russian-origin cargoes continue to discharge at European ports.

Students may choose from a pre-professional Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Dance Performance or from the more broad based Bachelor of Arts degree in Dance. Both degrees provide excellent preparation for those who plan to enter the professional dance world and/or attend graduate school. The curriculum for dance majors includes course work in choreography, dance history, dance production, dance performance, acting, music for dancers, dance science, dance teaching methods, ballroom, somatics, hip-hop, tap, and comprehensive pre-professional training in modern, jazz and ballet technique. The USC Glorya Kaufman School of Dance offers a Bachelor of Fine Arts to a select number of undergraduates who wish to pursue dance as their major. This four-year professional degree is housed in the state-of-the-art Glorya Kaufman International Dance Center. USC Kaufman also offers individual classes technique, performance, choreography, production, theory and history that are open to all students at USC. In addition to the dance major and open courses, the minor in Dance and minor in Dance in Popular Culture: Hip-Hop, Urban and Social Dances, provide a rewarding program of study for any USC student. A conservatory-based program within a liberal arts environment, we are focused on rigorous training in both ballet and modern technique. We are committed to the creation and production of original contemporary choreographic works by students, faculty and guest artists. The Dance Program is housed in its own state-of-the-art Dance Centre on a large liberal arts campus. USF is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Dance (NASD). Students must apply for admission and be accepted to the University of South Florida before they can be accepted as a Dance Major in the School of Theatre and Dance. Additionally, all prospective Dance Majors and Dance Minors must audition during the year prior to their first semester to be accepted into the Dance Program.</span><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-numeric: inherit; font-variant-east-asian: inherit; font-weight: 400; font-stretch: inherit; font-size: 16px; line-height: inherit; font-family: &quot;Open Sans&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; vertical-align: baseline; color: rgb(45, 46, 47); letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial;"><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font: inherit; vertical-align: baseline;"></span></span>','status' => '1','breaking_news' => '0','date' => '2021-10-19','tags' => 'movie','speciality_id' => '3','reporter_id' => '2','image' => '["uploads\\/images\\/newsimages\\/maannewsimage24102021_034150_dj.jpg"]','user_id' => '1','archive' => '0','viewers' => '132','meta_keyword' => NULL,'meta_description' => NULL,'created_at' => now(),'updated_at' => now()),

In no particular order, let’s take a brief look at the losers at Deadline Day:<br><br>1. Edmonton Oilers: They’ve been getting improved goaltending of late, but the Oilers not too long ago were in goalie hell with their current pair of Mikko Koskinen and Mike Smith. In Koskinen’s past two games, he’s put in sub-.900 save percentages, and in two of his past five appearances, Smith has posted a sub.860 SP.<br><br>Did Edmonton GM Ken Holland have all the reason in the world to go out and get a better goalie? He sure did. Could that failure to do so come back to haunt him once the playoffs begin? It sure could. Holland had all season long to find another netminder, and he knew the deadline was coming. It didn’t have to come to this, but now, it has. A goaltending crisis may prove to be what sinks the Oilers’ championship aspirations.<br>2. Toronto Maple Leafs: The Leafs land here with a caveat – namely, the acknowledgment that Toronto GM Kyle Dubas did improve his blueline and fourth line of forwards when he acquired D-man Mark Giordano and forward Colin Blackwell from Seattle on Sunday. However, their most pressing need – a veteran goalie to be given a shot at the No. 1 job until Jack Campbell returns from a rib injury – was not dealt with by the deadline.<br><br>That means, if rookie netminder Erik Kallgren crumbles under the pressure of the starter’s role, Leafs head coach Sheldon Keefe will have no other alternative but to use Petr Mrazek. And anyone who has watched Mrazek’s recent games will tell you that’s not a good thing. Mrazek’s .884 SP and 3.48 goals-against average show his struggles with Toronto this season, and the pressure is only going to increase on him, whenever the Leafs decide to play him. Another soft goal here or there and Mrazek will be quickly pulled from games.<br><br>Dubas has claimed he waived Mrazek over the weekend as a salary cap move, but who’s kidding who - you don’t waive someone you really want to keep around. If, for whatever reason, another franchise decided to take a chance on Mrazek – for this year, and two more years, with a $3.8 million annual cap hit – there would be little in the way of mourning over Mrazek’s departure. Instead, Leafs brass now has to be cold-blooded in their analysis and deployment of goalies. Campbell and Kallgren will get the first chances to run with the No. 1 job, and if they fail, it will fall on Mrazek to get one last shot at proving himself in Toronto.</span>','status' => '1','breaking_news' => '0','date' => '2021-11-04','tags' => 'Hocky','speciality_id' => '3','reporter_id' => '3','image' => '["uploads\\/images\\/newsimages\\/maannewsimage21102021_122640_hocky.jpg"]','user_id' => '1','archive' => '0','viewers' => '221','meta_keyword' => NULL,'meta_description' => NULL,'created_at' => now(),'updated_at' => now()),

Senator Kamala Harris of California became the nation’s first African American woman nominated for the vice presidency of the United States. It is a moment to be savored, a time to reflect, and a new journey to begin. Shirley Chisholm was the first African American woman elected to Congress, and the first Black major party candidate to run for president of the United States. In 1972 she said, “at present, our country needs women’s idealism and determination, perhaps more in politics than anywhere else.” The historicity of this hour reminds us again of that idealism, determination, and authentic sensitivity we often find in women. It just seems to be a part of who they are. It often appears in the way they govern. There is an undying belief on the part of women, expressed in the words of former presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton, “we are agents of change, we are drivers of progress, we are makers of peace – all we need is a fighting chance.” This is a bold move on the part of Vice President Joe Biden. It is another opportunity for our nation to move a little closer towards a more perfect union. It is a union for which Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said, “one day we will judge people not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.” While the NAACP does not endorse candidates, we are compelled to recognize the historic impact of these rare moments in time. This election will really be for the very soul of our nation. As the author James Cone has written When My Soul Looks Back, “it wonders how I get over.” I can hear the voice of Harriet Tubman humming. I can hear Ida B. Wells declaring, Fannie Lou Hamersinging, and Shirley Chisholm calling out the words of that old gospel song “he didn’t bring us this far to leave us.” It is time for everyone regardless of color, station, or vocation to Take Your Soles To The Polls.

Students may choose from a pre-professional Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Dance Performance or from the more broad based Bachelor of Arts degree in Dance. Both degrees provide excellent preparation for those who plan to enter the professional dance world and/or attend graduate school. The curriculum for dance majors includes course work in choreography, dance history, dance production, dance performance, acting, music for dancers, dance science, dance teaching methods, ballroom, somatics, hip-hop, tap, and comprehensive pre-professional training in modern, jazz and ballet technique. The USC Glorya Kaufman School of Dance offers a Bachelor of Fine Arts to a select number of undergraduates who wish to pursue dance as their major. This four-year professional degree is housed in the state-of-the-art Glorya Kaufman International Dance Center. USC Kaufman also offers individual classes in technique, performance, choreography, production, theory and history that are open to all students at USC. In addition to the dance major and open courses, the minor in Dance and minor in Dance in Popular Culture: Hip-Hop, Urban and Social Dances, provide a rewarding program of study for any USC student.

Market leaders like NIKE, Adidas, Under Armour, and PUMA, each had their own set of loyalists, from celebrities, and sports persons to the sports-crazy common man. But of late, even as the sportswear segment continues to grow, it has a new and more demanding driver – ‘women’. According to findings by Allied Market Research, the sportswear category will grow at a CAGR of 4.3 percent to reach a total market revenue worth US $ 184.6 billion by the year 2020. And though the men’s sportswear segment today constitutes around 52 percent of the revenue and is the highest revenue-generating segment in the sports apparel market, every brand has realized the potential of the women’s segment that is expected to grow at a relatively higher CAGR of 5.7 percent during the forecast period, as the involvement of women in sporting and fitness activities increases across the globe.</span></p><p style="outline: none; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 25px; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px; line-height: 1.8; color: rgb(49, 49, 49); font-family: Lato, sans-serif;">Every sportswear brand has in the last year added lines targeted specifically at the woman consumer. The momentum has now become so strong that even high-street retailers including Next have gone ahead to introduce sportswear apparel sections that cater exclusively to women.

Last year, they were the first female K-Pop group to reach number 1 in the UK and US album charts, and in 2020 their track "How You Like That" became the most viewed video on YouTube in 24 hours. (The group also wore modernized hanboks, designed by Kim Danha, in one of the music video\'s scenes.) Their landmark set over the weekend was in fact a follow-up to another milestone: In 2019, they became the first female K-Pop group to ever play at Coachella or any other US festival.</div><div>From the iconic Jean Paul Gaultier cone bra worn by Madonna for her 1990 Blond Ambition tour to Geri "Ginger Spice" Halliwell\'s Union Jack mini dress, the right stage costume can live on forever in public memory.
